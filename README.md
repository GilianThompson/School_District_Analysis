## Overview
For this project, the csv files containing student and school information were used and can be found in the Resources folder. 
Before any analysis was performed, the data was cleaned by checking for null or missing values, and removing prefixes and suffixes from studentsâ€™ names in the students_complete.csv file. 

## Results
A series of dataframes were created to show different metrics such as High and Low Performing Schools, Average Math and Reading Scores by Grade, Scores by School Spending per Student, Scores by School Size, and Scores by School Size. These can be found in the ```PyCitySchools.ipynb``` file
